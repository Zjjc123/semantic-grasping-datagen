# Semantic Grasping Datagen

This repository contains code for data generation, annotation, and inspection.

`data_annotation` contains a frontend for data annotation, served by the server in `src/annotation_server.py`. This is dockerized by `Dockerfile`.

The scripts in `scripts` launch beaker jobs for handling the data preprocessing and generation pipeline.
